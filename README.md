### Abstract

This paper addresses the problem of classifying a multivariate time series representing a human
brain electroencephalogram (EEG). Standard approaches using two-dimensional convolutions
fail to account for the spatial structure of the signal, since the sensors collecting the data are
located on a spherical surface. As a solution, we propose using a graph-based representation of
functional brain groups and modeling with neural diffusion.
